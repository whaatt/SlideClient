# Introduction #

This is the README for the Slide Server client API.

### Purpose ###

This library is meant to abstract some of the ugliness
involved in maintaining state with the socket server in
Slide. Please see the `docs` directory for full API
documentation in HTML format. If you prefer to use
Node-style callbacks instead of Promises, simply omit
the callback parameter in any function, and replace
the corresponding `functionName` with
`functionNameAsync` in your code.

### Setup ###

1. Clone this repository into some directory.
2. Download the newest version of Node.JS.
3. Run `npm install` in the same directory from Step One.
4. Run `npm run documentation` to generate the newest docs.
