# Introduction #

This is the README for the Slide Server client API.

### Purpose ###

This library is meant to abstract some of the ugliness
involved in maintaining state with the socket server. Please
see the `docs` directory for full API documentation in HTML
format. If you prefer to use the Promises style instead of
typical Node callbacks, simply omit the callback parameter
in any function, and replace the corresponding `functionName`
with `functionNameAsync` in your code.

### Setup ###

1. Clone this repository into some directory.
2. Download the newest version of Node.JS.
3. Run `npm install` in the same directory from Step One.
4. Run `npm run documentation` to generate the newest docs.
